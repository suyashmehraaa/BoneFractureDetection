# BoneFractureDetection
This project aims at detecting bone fractures from x-ray images and focuses on using various techniques for classification. It also aims at comparing the classification performance over different methods, like applying directly KNN and Naive Bayes Classifier on images' pixel values, then using Transfer Learning in which a ResNet50 model is used for classifying the images and is also used as a feature extractor and then again using KNN and Naive Bayes Classifier for classification, and lastly using a scratch CNN for classification, and using it as a feature extractor too with KNN and Naive Bayes Classifier. Results show that Transfer Learning is the best method adopted for the same.
